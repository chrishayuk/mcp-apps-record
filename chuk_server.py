"""
MCP Apps Record — three demo servers composed into one.

This is the chuk-mcp-server equivalent of server.py.

Instead of Starlette path mounts, chuk-mcp-server uses import_server()
to compose multiple servers into a single MCP endpoint. Tools get
namespaced with a prefix:

  simple.get_language_popularity    — Shot 3: plain text, no MCP Apps
  manual.show_chart                 — Shot 4: @mcp.view_tool() decorator
  decorator.show_popularity         — Shot 5: @chart_tool from chuk-view-schemas

Run locally:  uv run examples/chuk_server.py
